# hand-drawn-curve-parser
User draws a line by hand which is then parsed into a digital Catmull-Rom spline curve. Credit goes to Peter Cook for the curve code.  This code enables users to draw a line in their web browser.  Then, that line can be converted into a series of [x, y] coordinate pairs for analysis.

## To run this code

* Clone the repo.
* `cd hand-drawn-curve-parser`
* `open stepDad.html`  (or just open the local file in your web browser)
* Draw a line in the purple box.


Enjoy
